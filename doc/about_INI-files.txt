ini.h/ini.c - is an simple C99 module for parsing (read and write) INI-files.
The format is similar to that seen in Microsoft *.ini files but the
implementation is independent.

This labrary depend from str.h/str.c module only.
`str_t` type using for return ASCIZ dynamic string.
Pointer to standart ASCIZ string may be received by str_c() function.
After using `str_t` variable you must call str_free() function for free memory.

The INI-files are separated into sections, where the section names are
written inside square brackets. If you don't wish to use sections then
pass a empty string for the section name (like "").

Under each section are a set of key-value pairs, separated by an equals sign.
Equals sign may be: '=', ':=' or ':'. First time for write uses '='.
 
Spaces around keys and values are ignored.
Whitespace inside the value string is preserved;

If multiple entries for the same key exist inside the
selected section (if using) then only the first value is used. If
a section is defined more than once only the first is used. The INI-file
can contain comments, which begin with a semicolon (;) or hash (#).

Example INI-file format:
--------------------------------------------------------------
; Semi-colon comment
[network]
mac = 01:23:45:67:89:AB

# hash comment, leading spaces below
 gateway = 192.168.1.1

# extraneous spaces before and after key and value
 ip   =   192.168.1.2             

hosts_allow := example.com

# A similarly-named section
[network2]
mac         : ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee
subnet mask : 255.255.255.0

; Extra whitespace around the key and value is permitted
; (and ignored)
  hosts_allow =    sloppy.example.com  

[misc]
string  = 123456789012345678901234567890123456789001234567890
string2 = a string with spaces in it
string3 = "   Aaaa!   "

; This section is a repeat of en existing section and will be ignored.
[network]
mac := 01:23:45:67:89:ab
ip  := 192.168.1.2
